So just to give you an overview, we have 2
communication systems on the rover
2.4 ghz for small data and long ranges, and 5 ghz for
larger data and short ranges
We use 5 ghz mainly for video transmission, but let's
talk about 2.4 because that's how we send control
commands
So for 2.4, you need 2 antennas: one on the rover and
the other one is on the base station
Besides this, you need to create a local network. How
do you do that?
Well think about how we are communicating. You
have a router at your house (I assume) and if you look
into it, it either has a..255 or .â€¦0 format depending on
your network mask, indicating the router is your
gateway
So this gateway gives a private ip address to all of the
devices that're connected to it. That way, when I send
you a message, it goes to your router, and the
intended ip address and not someone else's ip
address on the network

You're gonna be doing the same thing. You need a
gateway. Now last year we used a raspberry pi to give
ip addresses to different devices, but midway through
the competition we switched to a router
You'd have to do a bit of research but you can always
ask we how to do all of this if you had a problem, but
essentially, once you hook up the antennas into your
local network with your chosen gateway, they then
have an ip address and so you can send commands
