# New System Notes


# Autonomy Goal Notes:
Rover will have a starting gps coordinate.
Rover to move to given gps coordinate.
Read AR codes along path to find next gps coordinates.
Need to avoid obstacles and have dynamic drive system. But generally stay on path to next gps coordinate.

# Comments
- Osiris's implementation was with using ros2 while Valk's system was a bit barebone. Need to investigate and integrate both systems into 1 or start fresh.
